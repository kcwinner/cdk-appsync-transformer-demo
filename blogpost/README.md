### The Challenge With AppSync

If you are familiar with AppSync, you know how frustrating it can be to build out a full API, writing each individual piece of the schema for your models, your connections, filters, queries, and mutations. Not only must you write the schema, you have to also write each resolver using velocity template language (VTL). A simple application can quickly become a few hundred lines of SDL, VTL, and Cloudformation. 

### [GraphQL Transform](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql-transformer/storage) Saves The Day

The Amplify CLI introduced some fantastic packages to help transform your AppSync schema into types, queries, mutations, subscriptions, tables, and resolvers using something called the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). Using [supported directives](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/graphql?sdk=js#directives) the CLI transformation plugin will transform your SDL into deployable templates, streamlining the process of creating AppSync APIs. 

An example directive for the @model directive looks like this:

```graphql
type Product
  @model {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    description: String!
    price: String!
    active: Boolean!
    added: AWSDateTime!
}
```

After transformation, we get the following schema, as well as resolvers and CloudFormation for a DynamoDB table.

```graphql
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  price: String!
  active: Boolean!
  added: AWSDateTime!
}

type ModelProductConnection {
  items: [Product]
  nextToken: String
}

input CreateProductInput {
  id: ID
  name: String!
  description: String!
  price: String!
  active: Boolean!
  added: AWSDateTime!
}

input UpdateProductInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  description: String
  price: String
  active: Boolean
  added: AWSDateTime
}

input DeleteProductInput {
  id: ID
}

input ModelProductFilterInput {
  id: ModelIDFilterInput
  name: ModelStringFilterInput
  description: ModelStringFilterInput
  price: ModelStringFilterInput
  active: ModelBooleanFilterInput
  added: ModelStringFilterInput
  and: [ModelProductFilterInput]
  or: [ModelProductFilterInput]
  not: ModelProductFilterInput
}

type Query {
  getProduct(id: ID!): Product
  listProducts(filter: ModelProductFilterInput, limit: Int, nextToken: String): ModelProductConnection
}

type Mutation {
  createProduct(input: CreateProductInput!): Product
  updateProduct(input: UpdateProductInput!): Product
  deleteProduct(input: DeleteProductInput!): Product
}

type Subscription {
  onCreateProduct: Product @aws_subscribe(mutations: ["createProduct"])
  onUpdateProduct: Product @aws_subscribe(mutations: ["updateProduct"])
  onDeleteProduct: Product @aws_subscribe(mutations: ["deleteProduct"])
}
```

Using the GraphQL Transform plugin, we turned 9 lines of SDL with a declaration into 62 lines. Extrapolate this to multiple types, and we begin to see how automated transformations not only save us time but also give us a concise way of declaring some of the boilerplate around AppSync APIs.

### Challenges of using AWS Amplify CLI

As outstanding as many of the features of the Amplify CLI are, I've found I personally prefer to define my resources using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) since it's easier to integrate with other existing systems and processes. Unfortunately for me, the transformation plugin only exists in the Amplify CLI. I decided that to emulate this functionality, I would take the same transformation packages used in the Amplify CLI and integrate them into my CDK project!

#### Recreating The Schema Transformer

To emulate the Amplify CLI transformer, we have to have a schema transformer and import the existing transformers. Luckily the Amplify docs show us an implementation [here](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/plugins?sdk=js). Since we want to have all the same directives available to us, we must implement the same packages and structure outlined above. This gives us our directive resolution, resolver creation, and template generation!

We end up with something like this:

```typescript
import { GraphQLTransform } from 'graphql-transformer-core';
import { DynamoDBModelTransformer } from 'graphql-dynamodb-transformer';
import { ModelConnectionTransformer } from 'graphql-connection-transformer';
import { KeyTransformer } from 'graphql-key-transformer';
import { FunctionTransformer } from 'graphql-function-transformer';
import { VersionedModelTransformer } from 'graphql-versioned-transformer';
import { ModelAuthTransformer, ModelAuthTransformerConfig } from 'graphql-auth-transformer'
const { AppSyncTransformer } = require('graphql-appsync-transformer')
import { normalize } from 'path';
import * as fs from "fs";

const outputPath = './appsync'

export class SchemaTransformer {
    transform() {
        // These config values do not even matter... So set it up for both
        const authTransformerConfig: ModelAuthTransformerConfig = {
            authConfig: {
                defaultAuthentication: {
                    authenticationType: 'API_KEY',
                    apiKeyConfig: {
                        description: 'Testing',
                        apiKeyExpirationDays: 100
                    }
                },
                additionalAuthenticationProviders: [
                    {
                        authenticationType: 'AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS',
                        userPoolConfig: {
                            userPoolId: '12345xyz'
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }

        // Note: This is not exact as we are omitting the @searchable transformer.
        const transformer = new GraphQLTransform({
            transformers: [
                new AppSyncTransformer(outputPath),
                new DynamoDBModelTransformer(),
                new VersionedModelTransformer(),
                new FunctionTransformer(),
                new KeyTransformer(),
                new ModelAuthTransformer(authTransformerConfig),
                new ModelConnectionTransformer(),
            ]
        })

        const schema_path = './schema.graphql'
        const schema = fs.readFileSync(schema_path)

        return transformer.transform(schema.toString());
    }
}
```

#### Writing Our Own Transformer

After implementing the schema transformer exactly the same, I realized it doesn't fit our CDK implementation perfectly. For example, instead of the JSON CloudFormation output of our DynamoDB tables, we want iterable resources that can be created via the CDK. In comes our own [transformer](https://github.com/kcwinner/cdk-appsync-transformer-demo/blob/master/lib/transformer.ts)! 

In this custom transformer, we do two things - look for the @nullable directive and grab the transformer context after completion. 

##### @nullable Directive

When creating a custom key using the `@key` direction on a model, the associated resolver does not allow for using `$util.autoId()` to generate a unique identifier and creation time. I've implemented this new directive using [graphql-auto-transformer](https://github.com/hirochachacha/graphql-auto-transformer) as a guide. This outputs a modified resolver for the field with our custom directive.

##### Post Transformation

After schema transformation is complete, our custom transformer grabs the context, searches for `AWS::DynamoDB::Table` resources, and builds a table object for us to create a table from later. Later, we can loop over this output and create our tables and resolvers like so:

```typescript
createTablesAndResolvers(api: GraphQLApi, tableData: any, resolvers: any) {
    Object.keys(tableData).forEach((tableKey: any) => {
      let table = this.createTable(tableData[tableKey]);

      const dataSource = api.addDynamoDbDataSource(tableKey, `Data source for ${tableKey}`, table);

      Object.keys(resolvers).forEach((resolverKey: any) => {
        let resolverTableName = this.getTableNameFromFieldName(resolverKey)
        if (tableKey === resolverTableName) {
          let resolver = resolvers[resolverKey]

          dataSource.createResolver({
            typeName: resolver.typeName,
            fieldName: resolver.fieldName,
            requestMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.fromFile(resolver.requestMappingTemplate),
            responseMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.fromFile(resolver.responseMappingTemplate),
          })
        }
      })
    });
  }
```

#### Using The Schema Transformer

To run our transformer before the CDK's template generation, we must import our transformer, run the transformer, and pass the data to our stack!

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { AppStack } from '../lib/app-stack';
import { SchemaTransformer } from '../lib/schema-transformer';

const transformer = new SchemaTransformer();
const outputs = transformer.transform();
const resolvers = transformer.getResolvers();

const STAGE = process.env.STAGE || 'demo'

const app = new cdk.App({ 
    context: { STAGE: STAGE }
})

new AppStack(app, 'AppStack', outputs, resolvers);
```

### Where Do We Go From Here?

We believe this would work much better as a CDK plugin or an npm package. Unfortunately, the CDK plugin system currently only supports credential providers at the moment. I played around with writing it in as a plugin (it sort of works), but you would have to write the cfdoc to a file and read it from your app to bring in the resources.
